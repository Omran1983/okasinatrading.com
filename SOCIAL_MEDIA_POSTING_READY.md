## 📞 Questions?

**Common Questions:**

**Q: Do I need a Facebook Business account?**
A: Yes, you need a Facebook Page (Business Page). Personal profiles can't use the API.

**Q: What about Instagram?**
A: You need an Instagram Business account linked to your Facebook Page.

**Q: Can I schedule posts?**
A: The API supports it, but we'd need to add a backend scheduler. For now, you can post immediately.

**Q: What about TikTok?**
A: TikTok has a separate API that requires different approval. I recommend posting to TikTok manually for now, or we can integrate it later.

**Q: Is this legal/allowed?**
A: Yes! This is the official Meta API. Thousands of businesses use it.

**Q: Will my posts look different?**
A: No! They'll look exactly like posts made from Facebook/Instagram apps.
